        <p>This is a website made by a chronically online teenager who's a bit fucked in the head. I'm sure there's some people who 
            will vibe with that so if that's you, hey :]
            <br>
            I have a lot of unexpressed thoughts and interests so I'll mainly use this site to spew all of that to the internet. Who 
            knows, you might find some value in it.
        </p>
        <h2>Contact Me??</h2>
        <p>If you have some overhelming urge to talk to me or or find out more about me or... idk bully me then feel free to stalk 
            my <a href="https://twitter.com/Kaynvink">twitter</a>. Or you can <a href="mailto: itsclassified682@gmail.com">email me</a>
